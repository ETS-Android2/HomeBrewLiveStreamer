# This application is a love letter (of sorts) to the Smashing Pumpkins

This is an open source application written in Java for live audio and video recording of media on Android devices. 
The genesis of this application is that the Smashing Pumpkins played a rockin three+ hour concert in Atlanta in July of 2018. 
I needed a reasonable reliable custom (roll-your-own) audio recording option to take to the show with me. 
It turns out that later that year, they live broadcast the same long set with stage props in Seattle 
(and [posted it to YouTube for posterity](https://youtu.be/9czpVjVL1wM)). 
The live concert required me to enroll in Twitter for the first time. My first tweet was about the 
Smashing Pumpkins. Their touring bassist, Jack Bates, liked my post as it seems that I was the only 
human (alien) on this planet without a Twitter account at that time. 

The Pumpkins live show is a tradition that my mom and my sister started back when I was in elementary 
school in 1996. Since then I have seen seven pumpkins shows with my mom. After turning twenty-one, this 
became an arrangement that I put up cash for the best seats we can get, and she buys us both enough 
alcohol at the bar so I do not have to miss a moment at (usually) the asking price for tickets to reciprocate. 
We missed the eighth Pumpkins show in Atlanta in 2020 due to a COVID-related cancellation of the festival they were 
set to headline. 

They are not only legendary musicians, but great guys: Billy and Jimmy put on a 
COVID era concert (of sorts) in the form of a listening party of some live Gish-era recordings for the 
price of a $50 concert tshirt on their website. 
This is all to say that no one should hate on Corgan for his lavish Pumpkin-mobile, a more expensive 
than normal tricked out orange Range Rover, at least according to reports in the media. It actually 
made me vow to get a Range Rover lease of my own to play the Pumpkins going to work once I have to 
get a proper software job this upcoming year üò∫ Billy and his creatively inspired designer wife have also 
been featured in Chicago magazines with their cats -- another soft spot for me personally. 

The icon in the service notification posted by the application is of a drum set. This was a natural choice 
for me as a drummer myself. And we all recognize that the Jazz specialist Jimmy Chamberlain is one of the 
most underrated modern rock drummers (of all time). 
**To Jimmy, James, Billy, Jon and their current touring bassist with love** üíù.
