## Application description

The application is a customizable, roll-your-own solution for live A/V recording to your 
Android device or for live media streaming. The concept of the app arose in the need for a 
covert customizable *home brew* A/V recording option which bypasses the need for interaction 
with external social networking apps and servers, i.e., we don't prefer to route our media through 
Facebook or Snapchat by default. Future versions of the application will include a richer A/V 
feature set and have options for live streaming applications to friend devices over the network 
(see the future / wishlist features list below). As the application matures slightly, the 
releases will include signed binary APKs for users to download and install without the need for 
compiling the source in Android Studio.

## Future features

1. Live streaming from phone to friend devices via a Bit Torrent **magnet** stream link
2. Editing of snapshot points in the audio / video with option for adding captions
3. More settings configurable in the *Settings* tab
4. Better A/V playback options of recorded media
