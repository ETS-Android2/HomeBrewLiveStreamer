## Application description

The application is a customizable, roll-your-own solution for live A/V recording to your 
Android device or for live media streaming. The concept of the app arose in the need for a 
covert customizable *home brew* A/V recording option which bypasses the need for interaction 
with external social networking apps and servers, i.e., we don't prefer to route our media through 
Facebook or Snapchat by default. Future versions of the application will include a richer A/V 
feature set and have options for live streaming applications to friend devices over the network 
(see the future / wishlist features list below). As the application matures slightly, the 
releases will include signed binary APKs for users to download and install without the need for 
compiling the source in Android Studio. 

## Installation and binaries

This freeware application is available for Android phones on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maxieds.codenamepumpkinsconcert). 
Please see our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/maxieds/HomeBrewLiveStreamer/wiki/PrivacyPolicy) (required per Google Play Store listing) for information on how the application manages its usage of sensitive Android permissions. Signed APK binaries of the 
application that can be installed on user Android devices are also incrementally available on the [releases page](https://github.com/maxieds/HomeBrewLiveStreamer/releases/latest) of this repository.
More complete documentation for the features of this application are found linked on the main wiki page [here](https://github.com/maxieds/HomeBrewLiveStreamer/wiki). 

## Features list

The current release of the application supports the following features:

* Recording of audio-only and audio-video files to the local Android device's internal memory (in ``Downloads/HomeBrewAVRecorder/*``). Due to restrictions on the Android permissions, the video stream recording must be performed with the device on and with the app in the foreground. However, the *audio-only* recording feature can be continued with the device in standby mode (i.e., with the screen turned off) so long as the app is in the foreground when the phone is switched off. This can save battery life when running the application for long periods of time to record background audio.
* Live playback of the last recording media stored by the application. 
* Various tools and effects for modifying the visual camera input from the device at recording time. 
* Extensive (though certainly not yet exhaustive) settings list for configuring the application at runtime. 
* Live streaming to *Facebook Live*. This has been tested by the developer and is known to work. 
* **[SEMI-TESTED]** Support for live streaming to *YouTube* broadcasts of various types and privacy levels.
